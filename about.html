      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Wisdom Pet  Medicine was founded by Dr. Darren Winthrop, Dr. Elizabeth Chase, and Dr.  Kimberly Sanders to bring the best in traditional and alternative medicine to  the local community. The three doctors met while pursuing their veterinary education  at Colorado State University, one of the nation's top-rated vet schools. After  going their own ways (for almost a decade), to work for different veterinary  clinics across the country, the doctors decided it was time to combine their  diverse knowledge and skills under one practice at Wisdom Pet Medicine.</p>
      <p>Our  veterinary hospital provides general and specialty vet medicine, and serves as  a major surgical center in the region. We're often referred difficult cases  from other vet clinics throughout the region, state, and country, and even  treat cases from other countries. With specialties in orthopedics, dermatology,  oncology, radiology, and ultrasound, we're able to diagnose and treat more  conditions in-house, allowing your pet to feel comfortable in friendly and  familiar surroundings for the duration of his or her care. We all love animals  and strive to make your pet's experience as positive as possible, and even have  a pet play yard in the back of our clinic where we give our overnight visitors  regular time away from the stress of confinement and treatment. We're proud to  say that most of our patients come in wagging their tails happily on return  visits - a true indicator that we've made them feel safe and secure. We're  honored that you've entrusted your pet's care to us, and we'll stand by our  commitment to provide the absolute best in veterinary medicine.</p>
